This repository contains the files required to build the Komiser Documentation Hub. To any [contributors](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) willing to add to the project, before anything else, Thank you!

## Contributing to the docs

- The best way to get started is by reading the ["Contributor's Guide" blog post](https://www.tailwarden.com/blog/how-to-contribute-to-komiser?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=referral) along with the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
- Afterwards, go ahead and **fork** the docs [repository](https://github.com/tailwarden/docs). Make any changes you want to your fork, and when you're ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request.

- If it takes longer than expected to get feedback from the `Tailwarden` team, head over to the [Discord Server](https://discord.tailwarden.com) and **ping** a Tailwarden staff member either in the `#general` or `#feedback` channel, unless you are a member of the private `contributor` channel. You can always request access to this channel. 

- Once your pull request has been opened, it will be assigned to one or more reviewers. Those reviewers will do a thorough code review, looking for correctness, bugs, opportunities for improvement, documentation, comments, and style

- Make sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation when creating or modifying features.
Once youâ€™ve received review and approval, your commits are squashed, and your PR is ready for merging.

- Congrats youâ€™re officially a Komiser contributor ðŸŽŠ
