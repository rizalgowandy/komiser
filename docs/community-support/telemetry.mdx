By default, the Komiser CLI collects some anonymous usage data. There are two types of data we collect:
- **Usage**: features usage, we use this data to understand which providers are being used and how much, which helps guide our roadmap and development efforts.
- **Errors**: stack traces sent whenever a panic occurs in the CLI. Having this data allows us to be notified when there is a bug that needs to be prioritized.

### We will never:

- Identify or track users.
- Collect personal information such as IP addresses, email addresses, or website URLs.
- Store data about your cloud resources or credentials .

## Why collect telemetry data?

We collect telemetry data for only two reasons: 

- In order to create a better product, we need reliable quantitative information. The data we collect helps us fix bugs, evaluate the success of features, and better understand our users' needs.

- We also need to prove that people are actually using Komiser. Usage metrics help us justify our existence to investors so that we can keep this project alive.

## What tools do we use to collect and visualize data?

We use [Segment](https://segment.com/), a platform for data collection and management, to collect usage data. We then feed that data into [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/), a tool for graphing and highlighting data, so that we can build visualizations according to our needs. As for error collection, we use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/).

## How to disable data collection

Data collection can be disabled at any time by setting a command-line option, then restarting the Komiser instance.

```
komiser start --telemetry false
```
