With this Custom views, users can filter their multi-cloud resources such as VMs, storage buckets, databases, and more, based on various criteria like tags, regions, resource type, service type, and more. The ability to apply complex filters and organize resources into logical segments enables users to see the cost breakdown of different parts of their application or cloud organization. 

This helps to provide a clearer understanding of cloud spend and resource utilization, allowing users to make informed decisions on cost optimization and resource allocation. The saved filters can be accessed quickly in the future, making it easy to track and monitor cloud spend over time.
