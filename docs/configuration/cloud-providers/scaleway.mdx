## Local Komiser CLI (Single account)

Komiser now supports multiple cloud accounts by default. Account configuration is done through the `config.toml` file, just pass in your account `Scaleway credentials`.

We've also added 2 methods of persisting your account data.
### Postgres
#### Add to config.toml file
```
[postgres]
uri="postgres://postgres:komiser@localhost:5432/komiser?sslmode=disable"
```
<Tip> For Postgres, Komiser anticipates the existence of a role `postgres` and a database `komiser` on the local Postgres server. </Tip>

### SQLite

```
[sqlite]
  file = "komiser.db"
```

### Configuring Credentials

The Scaleway credentials required to successfully integrate Komiser can be easily generated by:

#### Creating and [API key](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/) which generates `accessKey` and `secretKey`
- Click Identity and Access Management (IAM) from the top-right of your [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization) in the Scaleway console. You are taken to your [Identity and Access Management](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/users) dashboard.
- Click the `API Keys` tab.
- Click the `âž• button` to generate a new API key.
- Select the bearer of the API key. Choose between yourself (as an IAM user), or an IAM [application](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#application) associated with the Organization.
- Enter an optional description for the API key.
- Enter the desired `expiration` period.
- Click `Generate API Key`.

#### Locate the Organization ID
- Access the [Organization Dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/organization).
- In the Organization window click `Settings` to locate `organization ID`
- Add the credentials to your `config.toml` file

### Add your Scaleway credentials to your configuration file

```
[[scaleway]]
name="demo-scaleway-account"
accessKey="access_key"
secretKey="secret_key"
organizationId="organization_id"

[sqlite]
file="komiser.db
```
                                        

### Run it!
That should be it. Try out the following from your command prompt to start the server:

```
komiser start 
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Local Komiser CLI (Multiple accounts)
Simply add more authentication blocks to the configuration file

```
[[scaleway]]
name="demo-scaleway-account"
accessKey="access_key"
secretKey="secret_key"
organizationId="organization_id"

[[scaleway]]
name="demo-scaleway-account-2"
accessKey="access_key"
secretKey="secret_key"
organizationId="organization_id"

[[scaleway]]
name="demo-scaleway-account-3"
accessKey="access_key"
secretKey="secret_key"
organizationId="organization_id"

[sqlite]
file="komiser.db
```
